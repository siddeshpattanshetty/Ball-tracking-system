# Ball-Tracking usign OpenCV

I have been watching cricket for about 10 years and always wondered how a third umpire is tracking the ball for LBW wickets. Yeah, to check LBW, the ball will be tracked using computer vision application and trajectory will be projected based on angle, and other parameters. Being a Computer vision enthusiats trying hands-on is really cool.
